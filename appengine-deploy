#Update the Cloud SDK and install the Endpoints components:
gcloud components update

gcloud components update app-engine-java

#Make sure that Cloud SDK (gcloud) is authorized to access your data and services on Google Cloud Platform:
gcloud auth login

#Set the default project to your project ID:
gcloud config set project shop-maven-postgres

#Building the sample project
mvn clean package
mvn package -DskipTests

#Generating the OpenAPI configuration file
mvn exec:java -DGetSwaggerDoc

#Deploying the Endpoints configuration
gcloud service-management deploy openapi.json

#Set the ENDPOINTS_SERVICE_NAME environment variable to: [YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com
export ENDPOINTS_SERVICE_NAME=expense-tracker-178909.appspot.com
